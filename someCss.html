        <h1>Some CSS by Beck Taylor</h1>
        <h1 style="font-family: cursive;">This is my first paragraph 
        for the someCss project in Info 101. So far this class has taught
         me a lot about information technology and about the devices and 
         applications people like me use every day. 
        </h1>
        <p style="font-family: sans-serif">Success is peace of mind which 
        is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort
        to become the best you are capable of becoming.</p>
